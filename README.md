Project-Stock Prediction
I have used the Jupyter notebook.
Every time programs runs it pulls the fresh available data and generates Amazoon.csv for Amazon stock
If Sentiment analysis is enabled, it generates Sentiment.csv
The StickPrediction model uses the Sentlib.py to pull and normalize the sentiments.

Sample input and output are added that was generated on 04/17
